# pandas-challenge
I decided to do the Heroes of Pymoli homework because I am very interested in the marketing and business insights side of data analysis, and I thought this would be a good project to help get me started on that path.

My conclusions are written at the end of the file.

After importing dependencies and reading the csv file as purchase_data, the first thing I did was call the .columns function so knew what data I was working with and how to call it.

### Player Count

* Total Number of Players

- I calculated this by first counting the number of unique players using .value_counts on the SN column in purchase_data, then printing the length of that list.

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)

* Number of Unique Items
- I calculated this by counting the number of unique items using .value_counts on the Item ID column in purchase_data, then setting the length of that list as a variable called unique_items.

* Average Purchase Price
- I calculated this by finding the average price per item using .mean  on the Price column in purchase_data, then setting the result as a variable called avg_price.

* Total Number of Purchases
- I calculated this by counting the total number of purchases using .value_counts on the Purchase ID column in purchase_data, then setting the length of that list as a variable called total_purchases.

* Total Revenue
- I calculated this by finding the total amount spent on all items using .sum on the Price column in purchase_data, then setting the result as a variable called total_revenue.

- I then created a new data frame called pa_df with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
- Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

- Since some players made multiple purchases, but I needed a list where no one was listed multiple times I first created a subset of purchase_data called subset, that consisted of only unique players by using .drop_duplicates in the SN column in purchase_data.
- I then used .groupby on the Gender column in subset creating gender_groups.
- I totalled the number of players in each group using .count on gender_groups, resulting in the number of players for each gender category being stored in the variable gender_totals.
- I found the percentage each gender group made up of the total number of players by dividing the gender_totals by the length of the total_players and multiplying by 100.

- I then created a new data frame called gender demographics with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
- Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

* The below each broken by gender: 

- Since most of these calculations did not need a list of unique players, I used .groupby for Gender again, this time on purchase_data, creating purchases_by_gender (with accurate purchase totals, but some players listed multiple times).

  * Purchase Count
  - I found this by using .count on the Purchase ID column in purchase_data for each gender group, and stored the results as total_purchases_bg.
  * Total Purchase Value
  - I found this by using sum on the Price .column in purchase_data for each gender group, and stored the results as total_price_bg.
  * Average Purchase Price
  - I found this by using dividing total_price_bg by total_purchases_bg for each gender group, and stored the results as avg_price_bg.
  
 
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender
  - For this last calculation I needed to go by unique player, so I divided total_price_bg by gender_totals and stored the results as avg_spent_bg.

- I then created a new data frame called purchasing_analysis_bg with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
- Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Age Demographics

* The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.):

- I first broke up the players into bins by age, using the .cut function on subset (containing only unique players).
- I created a new column called Age Range in subset, and grouped the players by it using .groupby, creating grouped_by_ar.

- I totalled the number of players in each group using the .count function on grouped_by_ar, resulting in the number of players for each gender category being stored in the variable age_totals.
- I found the percentage each age group made up of the total number of players by dividing the age_totals by the length of the total_players and multiplying by 100.

- I then created a new data frame called age_demographics with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
- Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Purchasing Analysis (Age)
* The below each broken by Age Group:

- Since most of these calculations did not need a list of unique players, I repeated the binning, .cut, groupby Age Range process again, this time on purchase_data, creating purchases_by_age (with accurate purchase totals, but some players listed multiple times).

  * Purchase Count
  - I found this by using .count on the Purchase ID column in purchase_data for each age group, and stored the results as total_purchases_ba.
  * Total Purchase Value
  - I found this by using .sum on the Price column in purchase_data for each age group, and stored the results as total_price_ba.
  * Average Purchase Price
  - I found this by using dividing total_price_ba by total_purchases_ba for each age group, and stored the results as avg_price_ba.
  
 
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group
  - For this last calculation I needed to go by unique player, so I divided total_price_ba by age_totals and stored the results as avg_spent_ba.

- I then created a new data frame called purchasing_analysis_ba with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
- Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Top Spenders
* Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

  * SN
  - First I used .groupby on the SN column in purchase_data to create spenders_group, allowing me to run colculations on each spender that would encompass all of their purchases.

  * Purchase Count
  - I used .count on the Purchase ID column in spenders_group, and stored the results as total_purchases_bs.
  * Average Purchase Price
  - I used .mean on the Price column in spenders_group, and stored the results as avg_purchases_bs.
  * Total Purchase Value
  - I used .sum on the Price column in spenders_group, and stored the results as total_value_bs.

  - I then created a new data frame called top_spenders with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
  - I then created a new dataframe called sorted_spenders using .sort_values that presents the same data but sorted by Total Purchase Value in descending order.
  - Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.



### Most Popular Items

* Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):

  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  - I pulled the Item ID, Item Name, and Price columns from purchase_data and stored them in items.
  - I then used .groupby on Item Id and Item Name from items, creating grouped_items.

  * Purchase Count
  - I used .count on the Item Names column in grouped_items, and stored the results as purchase_count.
  * Item Price
  - I used .mean on the Price column in grouped_items, and stored the results as item_price.
  * Total Purchase Value
  - I used .sum on the Price column in grouped_items, and stored the results as total_purchase_value.

  - I then created a new data frame called popular_items with appropriate column titles, and plugged in the variables containing the results of my calculations.
  - I then created a new dataframe called sorted_items using .sort_values that presents the same data but sorted by Purchase Count in descending order.
  - Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.

### Most Profitable Itemsdescription

* Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * Item ID
  * Item Name
  * Purchase Count
  * Item Price
  * Total Purchase Value

  - I simply created a new sorted dataframe called profitable_items using .sort_values on popular_items, sorting by Total Purchase Value in descending order.
  - Finally, I cleaned up the formatting where appropriate.


### Description of three observable trends

- The 20-24 demographic spent more than twice the amount of the next highest spending (15-19), making them by far the most profitable age group. However, their average spent per person was not the highest, so working towards increasing number of players in other demographics may be a good idea.
- Similarly, total revenue from 'Males' was mnuch higher than the other gender distinctions, but their average spent per person was actually the lowest - perhaps increasing number of 'Female' and 'Other' players would be a good move.
- Certain games seem to be far more profitable than others despite similar pricing (high purchase numbers). It would be worth investigating differences in marketing campaign techniques or target demographics to look for any correlations.
